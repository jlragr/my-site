While planning my website, I wanted to achieve something that was fairly simple to use and navigate through
while also maintaining some sleekness. I wanted the site to be simple but enjoyable.
I planned on having my main body of text centered on the site with a simple but appealing background.
The top of the page containing the links to navigate through the site, with some of them using
common thumbnails such as email and home thumbnails.
I want to place a video on my home page to capture the users interest and give them a feel for the site.
The site will also contain images such as logos for my favorite sports team. 
Putting the logos there can give the user a better feel for the site, possibly give them something 
to relate to, while making the site a bit more visually appealing.
As a first website for a beginner, simplicity and ease of use is more of what I hope to target
while still keeping the user interested in navigating the site.
